# MediGuide Project

## Problem Statement:
Medication errors remain a critical issue in healthcare, contributing to a significant portion of preventable adverse events that harm millions of patients annually and lead to substantial healthcare costs. The complexity of medication instructions, coupled with patients' limited medical knowledge, often results in misunderstandings and incorrect medication use. These errors can occur at any stage of the medication process—prescribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring—and can lead to severe consequences, including adverse drug reactions, hospitalization, and even death. Despite efforts to improve patient safety, the challenge of effectively communicating accurate medication information to patients persists, necessitating innovative solutions to bridge this gap.
